# Contributing to Symbolos

Thanks for helping out. This is a small student-run project; the bar is
"don't break prod and leave the code a little better than you found it."

## One-time setup

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd ai-advisor

# Enable the pre-commit hooks (Python compile + lint + secret scan).
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

# Backend
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio ruff   # dev tools

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Copy `.env.local.example` → `.env.local` and fill in the keys (ask a
maintainer — never commit real keys).

## Running locally

```bash
# Backend (from backend/)
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (from frontend/)
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
```

## Before you open a PR

The pre-commit hook runs these automatically, but you can run them by hand:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m compileall -q api/
ruff check --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 api/
pytest tests/ -v

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

CI runs the same checks plus a secret scan and Lighthouse budget. PRs
can't merge until CI is green (and `main` is protected).

## Branch + commit conventions

- Branch off `main`: `feat/clubs-search`, `fix/calendar-tz`, `chore/deps`.
- Write a real commit message — what changed and *why*. The "why" is the
  part future-you will thank present-you for.
- Co-author tag at the bottom if pairing or AI-assisted.

## Where things live

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `backend/api/routes/` | One file per resource (chat, clubs, users, …) |
| `backend/api/utils/` | Shared helpers (supabase client, sanitise, email, telemetry gates) |
| `backend/migrations/` | SQL migrations — date-prefixed, idempotent, run manually in Supabase |
| `frontend/src/components/` | UI, grouped by feature |
| `frontend/src/lib/` | API clients + telemetry |
| `frontend/src/locales/` | EN / FR / ZH strings — **all three must be updated together** |

## House rules that matter

1. **Security invariants are tested.** `backend/tests/test_security.py`
   asserts the audit fixes (auth on every route, PII stripping, etc.).
   Don't weaken them to make a test pass — fix the code.
2. **i18n is not optional.** Any user-facing string goes in all three
   locale files. A missing key renders the raw `key.name` to users.
3. **No secrets in the repo.** The pre-commit hook + gitleaks will catch
   the obvious shapes, but be careful.
4. **Migrations are manual + idempotent.** Add `IF NOT EXISTS` / guard
   clauses so re-running is safe. After a schema change, dump the schema
   (see below).
5. **Don't add per-user data to edge-cached endpoints** (`/api/clubs`,
   `/api/courses/search`). They're `public`-cached — per-user data would
   leak across users. There's a CI test guarding this.

## Updating the schema dump

After any migration, regenerate the committed schema reference:

```bash
# Requires the Supabase connection string (read-only is fine).
pg_dump --schema-only --no-owner --no-privileges \
  "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" > backend/migrations/SCHEMA.sql
git add backend/migrations/SCHEMA.sql
```

This keeps a human-readable record of the DB shape in the repo so nobody
has to open Supabase Studio to answer "what columns does X have."

## Reporting a security issue

Don't open a public issue. See `/.well-known/security.txt` —
email the address there. We aim to respond within 72 hours.
